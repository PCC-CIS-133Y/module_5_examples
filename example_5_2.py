# example 5.2
# here are our list values
sandwiches = ["reuben", "ham and cheese", "meatball", "roast beef"]

# indexes start at [0].  Let's see what happens if we want to see index value [4]
print(sandwiches[4])

# this is called going out of range
# Can you fix this to get the fourth value?
